WritersBlockCMS (Demo)
# What is this?

A personal demo project built in Java with Swing
A small CMS‑like desktop app to explore and show my coding skills

Features a GUI with JTabbedPane, JTable, JEditorPane and more

# Why “Demo”?

Not a production system

Created purely to experiment and learn

A place to try out:

Custom table handling

HTML editing and saving

Dashboard concepts

# Highlights

HTML content rendering in a JEditorPane

Saving and loading articles from SQLite

Dashboard tab with recent items

Clear separation of data and view logic

A playground for new ideas

# Status

Demo-only – not meant for production use

Feel free to browse the code, give feedback, or take inspiration

# About Me

A long‑time trainee in Java and PHP

Exploring how logic becomes language and ideas become reality
